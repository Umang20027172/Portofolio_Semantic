### Capstone Project

- In the capstone project we need to make the resume reviewer so there was mainely three tasks that we have to focus on,

    1) Extracting the text from the Pdf uploaded 
    2) Text preprocessing 
    3) Final output streamlit application and deployment 


- For the preoject we have first decided the strategy and how we decided upon how our system will look like and then we have devided the task.
- So we have done 4-5 meetings and shared the outcome of the task assigned to eachother and we have built the final end product and ppt.
- Arun has done th part of the extracting text, Blesson is responsible for the text preprocessing and i have converted the all broken part into onepiece and made stramlit app and deployed it on streamlit plateform.

- So again we have putted equal efforts for the project as well.
