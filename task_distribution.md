###  Capstone Project â€“ Resume Reviewer   

For our capstone project, we developed a  Resume Reviewer, which involved three main tasks:  

1.  Extracting text from uploaded PDFs   
2.  Text preprocessing   
3.  Building and deploying a Streamlit application   

We began by strategizing how our system should function and then divided the tasks accordingly. Throughout 4-5 meetings, we collaborated, shared our progress, and integrated our work into a complete end product and presentation.  

-  Arun  handled text extraction from PDFs.  
-  Blesson  was responsible for text preprocessing.  
-  Umang  worked on integrating all components, developing the Streamlit application, and deploying it.  

Each of us contributed equally to ensure the project's success.
