### LSTM Presentation   
- Blesson covered the introduction section of the presentation.  
- Umang explained the inner workings of LSTMs.  
- Arun presented the experiments and results.  

Each team member contributed equally to the presentation.  


###  Sparse Transformers Presentation   
- Blesson was responsible for the introduction.  
- Arun explained the architecture and how Sparse Transformers function.  
- Umang presented the experiments and results.  

Once again, we divided the workload equally and collaborated effectively on the presentation.  


###  Onion Classifier   

The data was pre-processed, and then feature extraction was done on the processed data. 
We got maximum metrics by using  DistilBERT for Sequence Classification and DistilBERT Tokenizer for tokenization.
The Training Process was done using AdamW Optimizer with a learning rate scheduler for 10 epochs. 

The reported final metrics are:

Accuracy: 0.9199

F1 Score: 0.8901

Precision: 0.9167

Recall: 0.8650

The task was distributed amongst all team members equally, where we tested and tried for different solutions.

###  Capstone Project â€“ Resume Reviewer   

For our capstone project, we developed a  Resume Reviewer, which involved three main tasks:  

1.  Extracting text from uploaded PDFs   
2.  Text preprocessing   
3.  Building and deploying a Streamlit application   

We began by strategizing how our system should function and then divided the tasks accordingly. Throughout 4-5 meetings, we collaborated, shared our progress, and integrated our work into a complete end product and presentation.  

-  Arun  handled collecting dataset and feature extraction using different methods.  
-  Blesson  was responsible for text preprocessing.  
-  Umang  worked on integrating all components, developing the Streamlit application, and deploying it.  

Each of us contributed equally to ensure the project's success.
