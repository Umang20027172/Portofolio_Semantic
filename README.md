This repo describe our work for the subject this semester. It includes presentations of the two papers presented in class, LSTM and Sparse Transformers.
It also includes a folder for Onion classifier, consisting of the dataset and a notebook with the code. 

Finally we have our Capstone Project: CV Reviewer, which automates resume screening, provides AI-based insights for resume improvement. Furthermore, it improves job match percentage using Applicant Tracking System (ATS) criteria and 
 offers real-time feedback for better job applications.
